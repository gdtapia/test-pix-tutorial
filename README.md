# test-pix-tutorial

The purpose of this test was to explain "How to configure a pix key" (available in the file "2. How to configure a Pix key.md"). Other aspects of this test included showing the idea of structuring a page and a documentation. With this I came up with this structure:

# Pix
## Pix keys
### How to configure a Pix key
## Payments using Pix
### Send money
#### Transfer method
#### QR code method
